    "To simulate a network, it is necessary to understand how network nodes are interconnected and how data flows are created and transmitted across the network. For example, in the provided network structure, data flows are initiated by reading data from sensors. The data then undergoes processing, which can be executed by either Edge devices or Cloud servers. The simulation can be utilized to estimate how network performance depends on the distribution of data flows between Edge and Cloud processing devices. Additionally, it aids in determining the number of devices needed to meet waiting time requirements, estimating costs, and exploring various scenarios.\n",
